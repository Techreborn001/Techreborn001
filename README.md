## Immanuel Mbugua - Cloud & DevOps Engineer

Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"> Welcome to my Cloud - Dev Profile!

I'm **Immanuel Mbugua**, a 2x AWS Certified professional and an aspiring Cloud/DevOps Engineer with a strong foundation in full-stack development.

My passion lies in bridging the gap between **robust**, **scalable cloud architecture** and efficient software development. I specialize in building **resilient applications** and optimizing deployment pipelines using automation.

## 🚀 About My Journey

I am a detail-oriented problem-solver with proven hands-on experience in complex technical environments. My journey accelerated when I was selected as one of only 15 interns from over 3,000 applicants for the inaugural AWS Kenya Cloud Support Engineer Internship.

### My key areas of expertise include:

- **Cloud Architecture:** Designing and managing infrastructure using AWS Core Services (EC2, Lambda, VPC, RDS, S3) guided by my AWS Solutions Architect - Associate certification.

- **Automation:** Developing JS (IaC) scripts to streamline support workflows, automate infrastructure tasks, and enhance system reliability.

- **Full-Stack Capability:** Proficient in creating enterprise-grade applications using **React** on the frontend and **Express.js**, **Node.js**, and **PostgreSQL (PERN)** on the backend.

- **DevOps Focus:** Leveraging **Docker** and **Kubernetes** principles for containerization, and integrating CI/CD practices to ensure fast, reliable deployments.

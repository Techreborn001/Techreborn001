## ☁️ Cloud Support Engineer | DevOps Enthusiast | Full-Stack Developer

I am a 2x AWS Certified professional and an aspiring Cloud/DevOps Engineer. My journey accelerated when I was selected as one of only **15 interns from over 3,000 applicants** for the inaugural **AWS Kenya Cloud Support Engineer Internship.**

I specialize in bridging the gap between robust cloud architecture and efficient software development through automation and resilient systems.

Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my Cloud - Dev Profile!
I'm Immanuel Mbugua, a 2x AWS Certified professional and an aspiring Cloud/DevOps Engineer with a strong foundation in full-stack development.
My passion lies in bridging the gap between robust, scalable cloud architecture and efficient software development. I specialize in building resilient applications and optimizing deployment pipelines using automation.
🚀 About My Journey
I am a detail-oriented problem-solver with proven hands-on experience in complex technical environments. My journey accelerated when I was selected as one of only 15 interns from over 3,000 applicants for the inaugural AWS Kenya Cloud Support Engineer Internship.
My key areas of expertise include:
•	Cloud Architecture: Designing and managing infrastructure using AWS Core Services (EC2, Lambda, VPC, RDS, S3) guided by my AWS Solutions Architect - Associate certification.
•	Automation: Developing JS (IAC) scripts to streamline support workflows, automate infrastructure tasks, and enhance system reliability.
•	Full-Stack Capability: Proficient in creating enterprise-grade applications using React on the frontend and Node.js, and PostgreSQL (PERN) on the backend.
•	DevOps Focus: Leveraging Docker and Kubernetes principles for containerization, and integrating CI/CD practices to ensure fast, reliable deployments.
